{% note %}

**Welcome to the beta release notes for Home Assistant 2024.9** üéâ

<br />

Please note that these release notes are a work in progress. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We will be
completing them over the next couple of days. Not all features might be final
yet, and some features _**may not** make it into the final release_.

<br />

**Want to help test the beta?** Awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è We have documented how you
[can join our beta channel and install the beta here](/common-tasks/os/#running-a-beta-version).

<br />

While running the beta, we highly recommend joining our _#beta_ channel on
the [Home Assistant Discord chat](/join-chat)! üí¨ Most developers and beta
testers are in this channel during the beta period to share experiences, ideas,
and iterate over new features, fine-tuning them before the final release.
It's a really fun place to hang out. üòé

<br />

**Reporting issues**: As this is a beta test, you might encounter unexpected
behavior or issues. üêû We use the GitHub issue tracker to track beta issues.
You can find our issue trackers and the reported issues during beta here:

<br />

- [Report(ed) beta **dashboards/UI/frontend** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/milestone/123)
- [Report(ed) beta **integrations/automations/backend/core** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/milestone/686)
- [Report(ed) beta **documentation** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/milestone/130)

üôè When reporting issues, **make sure to mention the exact beta version you are
running** in the issue description. This will help us identify and track the
issue correctly. Read more about [reporting issues here](/help/reporting_issues/).

<br />

Issues introduced in the beta are processed with priority. üîù

## Dashboards

As part of our [roadmap](/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#dashboards), work has
continued on making dashboard customization and organization easier and more
intuitive.

## Integrations

Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new {% term integrations %}
and improvements to existing ones! You‚Äôre all awesome ü•∞

### New integrations

We welcome the following new integrations in this release:

- **[Anthropic Conversation]**, added by [@Shulyaka]  
  Use AI by [Anthropic], like the [Claude 3.5 Sonnet] as a conversation agent in Home Assistant.

[@Shulyaka]: https://github.com/Shulyaka
[Anthropic Conversation]: /integrations/anthropic
[Anthropic]: https://anthropic.com/
[Claude 3.5 Sonnet]: https://www.anthropic.com/claude

This release also has new virtual integrations. Virtual integrations
are stubs that are handled by other (existing) integrations to help with
findability. These ones are new:

- **[Lorem slipsum]**, provided by [Lorem ipsum], added by [@frenck]

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[Lorem ipsum]: /integrations/lorem_ipsum
[Lorem slipsum]: /integrations/lorem_slipsum

### Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations

It is not just new {% term integrations %} that have been added; existing
integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:

- The [Lorem ipsum] integration now supports slipsum! Thanks [@frenck]!

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck

{% enddetails %}

### Integrations reaching platinum quality level

The following {% term integrations %} have reached the platinum üèÜ level on our
[integration quality scale](/docs/quality_scale). These integrations are
the best of the best and give you an excellent out-of-the-box experience.

- **[Lorem ipsum]**, done by [@frenck]

Congratulations to all the developers who worked on these integrations!

[Lorem ipsum]: /integrations/lorem_ipsum
[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[Lorem ipsum]**, done by [@frenck]

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[Lorem ipsum]: /integrations/lorem_ipsum

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **Asterisk Call Detail Records** and **Asterisk Voicemail**. Previously
  deprecated and now removed. They have been using a deprecated mailbox feature
  that is no longer available.

## Other integration lorem ipsum

lectus tortor, dignissim sit amet, adipiscing nec, ultricies sed, dolor. Cras

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Proximity" %}

In [2024.2 we introduced new sensor entities](/blog/2024/02/07/release-20242/#revamped-proximity-integration)
to the [Proximity](/integrations/proximity) {% term integration %} and¬†
therefore deprecated the `proximity` entity.

Now this deprecated `proximity` entity has been removed removed.

([@mib1185] - [#123158]) ([documentation](/integrations/proximity))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#123158]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/123158
